The code inside GaussianDiffusion.py and Unet.py was adapted from that found at https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch/blob/main/denoising_diffusion_pytorch/classifier_free_guidance.py

The code inside Trainer.py was adapted from https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch/blob/main/denoising_diffusion_pytorch/denoising_diffusion_pytorch.py

The code inside helper_functions.py comes from both.
